# A for loop in Python is used to repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). It is commonly used when you know how many times you want to execute a block of code.
# for letters in "Hello":
#     print(letters)
    # Table using Forloops

#     for i  in range(1, 11):
# print(f"2 X {i} = { 2*i}")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"2 X {i} = {2*i}")
